# Stroke-Prediction
Developed a stroke prediction model using healthcare data. Performed data cleaning, outlier removal, encoding, and SMOTE for class balance. Trained and evaluated Logistic Regression, KNN, Random Forest, and MLP neural network. Used ROC curves and confusion matrices to assess performance. Neural network showed the highest accuracy.
